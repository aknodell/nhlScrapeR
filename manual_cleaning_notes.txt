	- 2019021053 
		- TB 24, 17, 98, 71 and BOS on ice 74, 37, 63, 47, 88 still on at 2369 per YouTube highlights https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJR3bAW4IIg

		- all STL players on ice at end of game missing their last shift
	- 2019021034
		- Lots of discrepancies around the end of the MTL PP at 419, YouTube supports the HTML report/PBP https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-Z1IGVWKzo
		- leave Sergachev's third period shift alone, no video, the PBP doesn't suggest tampa had an uncalled TMM
	- 2019021019
		- incorrect starting lineup, removed Kucherov and added Killorn and Coleman for first 43 seconds
		- extended krejci and ritchie's PP shift to end at 228
		- started grzelcyk's shift at 227 instead of 268
		- fixed start for hedman's first shift of third period
		- Added Rask's third period
		- Added Bergeron and Coburn's first shift of the third period (39 seconds)
	- 2019021000
		- mismatches around the beginning of the third period (2559-2705ish) PBP on ice supports the HTML shift reports, so leaving alone
	- 2019020963
		- extended bernier's second period shift to cover whole period
		- added shift for bernier to start third period until delayed penalty
		- added first shifts for daley, mantha, and larkin
	- 2019020941
		- leave the way it is, no reason to think NYI played with TMM for 54 seconds (PBP doesn't support this either)
	- 2019020937
		- leave the way it is, API has a weird double shift for morissey for some reason
	- 2019020898
		- leave the way it is, API has Klefbom and Larsson starting their shift at 1858 instead of 1894 and Matt Benning has a phantom shift for the same time period (PBP has a weird 0 second on-ice event for these three at 1858)
		- Khaira has a 1 second disparity, but nothing in the PBP to support
	- 2019020852
		- all DAL players on ice for EOG missing last shift, easy to add
	- 2019020842
		- remove Spurgeon's shift from 263 to 270 and give that time to Dumba (doesn't seem likely Spurgeon replaced Dumba for 7 seconds and then changed for Dumba again)
		- Ignore zuccarello shift diff, API thinks he jumped on with Kunin and MIN had TMM
	- 2019020815
		- leave, API has Rooney and Hayden staying on the ice after the PK starts allowing NJD to play 6 on 5 when they're supposed to be shorthanded
	- 2019020808
		- add Slavin's first shift of OT (37 seconds)
	- 2019020775
		- add talbot's shift for third period
		- add hamonic and backlund's first shifts of third period (28 seconds)
	- 2019020772
		- missing last shifts for all STL players on ice at EOG
		- had Pietrangelo and Schwartz get on 10 seconds earlier to match end of Faulk and Parayko's shifts
	- 2019020754
		- leave, I don't think Lebanc jumped on the ice and SJ played with TMM for 12 seconds
	- 2019020743
		- leave, API has PP unit staying on after goal at 1771 with Matt Martin joining for TMM off the next faceoff
	- 2019020726
		- extend pietrangelo's last shift of third period to EOP, add his missing shift at start of OT (79 seconds)
		- added schenn's last shift (visible on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztRCxKsrbG8)
		- extend binnington's third period to EOP, add his missing OT shift
	- 2019020722
		- extend bishop's third period shift to cover whole period
		- add bishop, seguin, and lindell's shifts to start OT
	- 2019020710
		- this one's incredibly messy, lots of players supposedly taking extremely short shifts and then changing back to the players who were previously on.  Probably wrong, but no way to correct most of it
		- change haley's shift starting at 126 to end at 133 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oY2-SQfU9Jk) 
		- remove howden's shift from 132 to 133
		- leave haley's shift from 445 to 451 alone (matches PBP)
		- leave all changes at 501 (matches PBP)
		- have fast play full shift from 3015 to 3094 instead of stepping off for one second at 3026
		- remove staal shift from 3168 to 3172
		- add brassard to PP from 3219 to 3347?
		- give staal's shift from 3424 to 3446 to chytil
		- remove nelson and johnston shifts from 3494 to 3498
		
		- something's screwy with NYR defense after 14:51 of third

Notes on event cleaning
	- 2019021053 
		- STOP at 2334 was because a goal was scored at 2317, just remove the STOP
		- Coburn hit on Pastrnak at 2374 probably happens when Coburn is on bench, don't know who hitter was, so just remove
			- Coburn is still on at 2369 and BOS has possession in offensive zone per highlights on YouTube.  Seems implausible one to TB's defensemen went for a change while BOS was threatening and 5 seconds probably not enough time for TB to get puck out, TB change, BOS re-enter, and Coburn lay hit.  Coburn probably changed with the rest of the PK squad at 2393
