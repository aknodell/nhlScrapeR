# Notes on after goal corrections
A goal being scored is always followed by either a faceoff or a period/game end.  In the following cases, a goal was scored, but there is no corresponding "after goal" event in either the HTML or API play-by-play.  Below is a comprehensive list of all event corrections manually added to the PBP.  When a faceoff event is added, I just made note of the event without specifying who took/won the faceoff.  For the most part, the missing faceoffs come after a goal was scored in the last second or two of the game.
